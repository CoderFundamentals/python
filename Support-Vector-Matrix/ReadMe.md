## Vector
- Vectors can be thought of as list of things, and in multivariable calculus it can be numbers mostly.
- So when we think of numbers, then it can be represented with a magnitude and direction and can be considered as points in space

-Vectors also support basic operations such as addition, scalar multiplication. Also the general question of how long a vector is , is represented as Magnitude of the vector. The magnitude is calculated by using the Pythagoras formulae of distance.

### Dot Product
- The Dot Product tells how much two vectors point in the same direction.
- The Dot Product of two vectors a, b is computed as cosine of the magnitude of a and b.	
	-	$\vec{a}$ . $\vec{b}$  =  a.b $\cos( \theta$)
	-	When Both a, b are in same direction then the dot product is at its largest , as $\theta$ is 0 degree

- However it is also represented in a simplified manner:
	-  If  $\vec{a}$ = ( a$_1$, a$_2$, a$_3$) and $\vec{b}$ = (b$_1$,b$_2$,b$_3$)
	-  $\vec{a}$ . $\vec{b}$ = a$_1$.b$_1$+a$_2$b$_2$+a$_3$b$_3$
